# Wuduh — وضوح

Card-based feasibility study builder for first-time founders in Saudi Arabia and the GCC.

## What it does

Founders answer 58 focused cards across 8 sections. When done, Wuduh assembles their answers into an investor-ready feasibility study PDF in Arabic or English.

| File storage | MinIO (self-hosted on Coolify, S3-compatible) |
| Email | Resend |
| PDF generation | PDFShift |
| Hosting | Coolify (self-hosted on VPS) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + CSS variables (design tokens) |
| DNS | Cloudflare |
| Domain | wuduh.site |

## Database schema

The PostgreSQL database (`wuduh`) contains 8 tables:

**Better Auth tables** (camelCase columns):
- `users` — registered accounts
- `sessions` — active sessions
- `accounts` — OAuth / email-password credential links
- `verifications` — email verification tokens

**Wuduh tables** (camelCase columns):
- `profiles` — founder display name and preferences
- `studies` — feasibility studies (userId, startupName, language, completionPercentage, etc.)
- `answers` — card answers (studyId, cardId, answer as JSONB, status)
- `exports` — PDF export history

## Deployment

The app runs on Coolify (self-hosted). Three Docker resources in the `Wuduh / production` environment:

1. **wuduh app** — Next.js app built via Dockerfile, served on port 3000
2. **postgresql-database** — PostgreSQL 17 Alpine, port 5432
3. **wuduh-minio** — MinIO via Docker Compose, ports 9000 (API) and 9001 (console)

Domain `wuduh.site` is managed on Cloudflare DNS pointing to the VPS IP.

## Design tokens

Colors:
- Navy: `#0D1B2A`
- Gold: `#C9A84C`
- Teal: `#0D9488`

Fonts:
- Display: IBM Plex Serif
- Body: IBM Plex Sans
- Mono: IBM Plex Mono
- Arabic: IBM Plex Sans Arabic

Dark mode is implemented via CSS variables on the `.dark` class (toggled by ThemeProvider).

## Card system

58 cards across 8 sections (plus a cover page), defined in `wuduh-cards.json` and loaded via `src/lib/cards/loader.ts`.

Card types:
- `text` — free-text textarea with auto-save
- `table` — multi-row structured input (competitors, team members, risks)
- `upload` — image upload to MinIO (logo)
- `lang` — language selection (first card, sets study language)

Each card has English and Arabic translations including prompt, helper text, hint, and example.

## Roadmap

The MVP is delivered and live at wuduh.site. Remaining work is sequenced so that monetization comes last and the AI validator follows it:

1. **Next feature phases** — financial projections engine + export charts, theme gallery + designer marketplace, accelerator white-labeling, living document (return-and-update with version history), investor shareable link, documentation hub, and an accelerator API. Edge-level JWT auth hardening sits alongside these as a technical item.
2. **Final phase — Payment system.** Moyasar (MADA support), SAR 99 per export. Intentionally sequenced last; monetization is switched on once the product depth is complete.
3. **After payment — AI input validator.** The last item on the roadmap, deferred until payment ships. Planned as on-device (in-browser) inference so it adds no server cost or external dependency.
